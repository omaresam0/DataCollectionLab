## üîç Purpose of This Repository

## üåü Ethical Guidelines

I firmly believe in responsible web scraping. To ensure my work aligns with this principle, I follow these ethical guidelines:
1. **Public Data Only:** I only scrape data that is publicly accessible and does not violate website terms of service.
2. **Respect Robots.txt:** I respect the rules set in websites' `robots.txt` files and avoid scraping restricted areas.
3. **No Login Required:** No scraping behind login pages or paywalls unless I have explicit permission.
4. **Rate Limiting:** I implement appropriate rate limits to prevent overloading servers.
5. **Cite Sources:** Whenever possible, I attribute the data source to its original website.
